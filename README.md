MediScan is a cutting-edge AI-powered project designed to address the critical
challenge of timely and accurate diagnosis of eye diseases. By harnessing
advanced deep learning techniques, MediScan simplifies the diagnostic process,
enabling healthcare professionals to focus on treatment rather than lengthy
diagnostic procedures. The project aims to democratize access to medical
diagnostics by providing an accessible and reliable tool for eye disease detection.

This project is particularly significant in todayâ€™s healthcare landscape, where
early detection of diseases like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and macular
degeneration can prevent severe complications, including blindness. MediScan
not only provides insights for diagnosis but also empowers medical practitioners
to make informed decisions.
